# Single cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal phenotypes of TLS-associated macrophages

## 📌 Overview
Recent years have seen an increasing interest in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) as **potential biomarkers** for predicting responses to immunotherapy. However, there is **limited
understanding** of the phenotypes of **tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)** populations within TLS, even though they play an important role in the induction and development of TLS. Thus 
this study aims to fill this knowledge gap by utilizing single-cell and spatial technology. 

## 🧬 Data
**Single-cell transcriptomics data:** publicly available datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE186344, GSE174401, GSE234832). They are brain metastasis samples from different primary tumor sites.
**Spatial transcriptomics data:** GSE175540 contains 24 spatial transcriptomics samples from clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues (ccRCC).

## ⚙️ Methods and Workflow 
- **Single-cell analysis:** 
- **Spatial analysis:** Macrophage localization patterns near TLS regions.
