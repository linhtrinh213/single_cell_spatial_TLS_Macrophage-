All of the datasets used in this project are publicly available datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).  

# Single-cell transcriptomics datasets
- GSE186344: all samples from GSE186344 were taken in from the datasets, except for Rhabdomyosarcoma (GSM5645906), Breast_1_Biological_Replicate (GSM5645908), and 2 mouse models samples (GSM5645909 and GSM5645911). 15 samples were included from this study.

- GSE178481: single-cell transcriptomics data utilized as a reference to perform deconvolution. Specifically, three tumor samples from one patient with stage 2 ccRCC were taken from this dataset (GSM392421, GSM392422, GSM392423).
